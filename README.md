# Email Reply Assistant

Email Reply Assistant is a web application that leverages AI to help users quickly read, generate, and send email replies using Google's Gmail API and Gemini language models. The app provides a simple UI to fetch unread emails, generate smart replies in various tones, and send responses directly from your Gmail account.

## Features

- **Gmail Integration**: Authenticate with your Gmail account to fetch unread emails and send replies seamlessly.
- **AI-Powered Reply Generation**: Uses Gemini language models to generate context-aware replies to incoming emails.
- **Customizable Tone**: Choose the tone of your replyâ€”formal, casual, friendly, or apologetic.
- **Editable Replies**: Edit the generated reply before sending.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Simple and interactive web UI for managing email replies.

## How It Works

1. **Authenticate**: The app uses Google OAuth2 to connect to your Gmail account.
2. **Fetch Latest Email**: Pulls the latest unread email from your inbox.
3. **Generate Reply**: The AI reads the email and generates a reply in your chosen tone.
4. **Edit & Send**: You can review and edit the reply before sending it back to the sender.
